## README Description

This repository analyzes how trader behavior, market sentiment, and time-of-day patterns influence trading profitability. Using real trading data and behavioral analytics, it uncovers:

- **Why most trades and profits are concentrated in low-priced (penny) coins**
- **How calm, disciplined trading outperforms impulsive, aggressive strategies**
- **The impact of market sentiment (greed, fear, neutrality) on trader outcomes**
- **Why morning trades yield the highest average profits and lowest losses**
- **Why late-night trading is favored by top-performing, disciplined traders**
- **The risks of night-time trading and trading high-priced assets**
- **How only a few traders consistently outperform by adapting strategies and managing risk**

The project includes visualizations (KDE plots, time-of-day breakdowns), behavioral insights (crossed vs. non-crossed trades), and coin-specific analysis. Actionable takeaways help traders optimize strategy, timing, and asset selection for greater profitability.
